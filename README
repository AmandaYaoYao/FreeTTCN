Chapter I - Basic information

'freettcn' project provides 3 basic modules:

1. TTCN code interpreter + C++ code generator + libfreettcn.so library (TE)

  Only this module is necessary to create TTCN Executable library. It provides:
   - freettcn - TTCN code translator to C++ language (run 'freettcn -h' after
   instalation for more info). It converts all module specific data from TTCN
   source module file to C++ file.
   - libfreettcn.so - contains all core TE functionalities. Code is written
   in C++ language but it uses standardized C language interface to communicate
   with other entities of TTCN test environment.
   
  
2. TTCN environment library (TM, TL, CH, CD, SA, PA)
  
  libfreettcnenv.so library contains example implementation of the rest of
  TTCN environment entities. Every entity is a standalone implementation
  with standardized C language interface. Final user application can use all,
  any or none of these entities.


3. 'freettcn' project usage example

  That module provides simple final implementation of all TTCN environment
  entities and some TTCN source module files with corresponding CD and SA
  information.
